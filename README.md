Bay
===

An easy HTTP service builder with dependency injection supported by Dado. 
Definitely an awesome way to structure your backend.

Notice
------

Everything in here is experimental as Dado itself is experimental. Beware, Dado is a git dependency, so Bay might stop
working.
Documentation and testing are lacking. Nevertheless, this seems promising.
